# Rocks-and-Minerals
This program uses flask, html and sql to create a database for geologists. It is possible to add a locality and country to begin with. It is also possible to add a rock type, including name, type and age. Together the user can figure out where rocks are found and which type they have. Further more the user can add samples, which have an id, rock type, etc. All attributes can be viewed in the ERD.
The SQL and Python_SQL are used to instantiate the databse and can be deleted through them. It is up to user if they want to use the python console or SQL commands to do this.
The static folder contains a css file, which has not been implemented yet.
The templates folder contains the html files, which create the homepage and lets the user interact with the database.
The program runs from the app.py file and uses sqlUtils to post and get information to the database.
